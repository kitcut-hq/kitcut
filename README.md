# video-captions

Add word-synced burned-in captions to a video — a "real time transcript" where
the currently-spoken word is highlighted — from a YouTube URL or a local file.

Runs entirely locally: `faster-whisper` for word-level timestamps, a generated
ASS subtitle file for styling, and NVENC to burn it in. No API keys, nothing
uploaded.

```powershell
python -X utf8 -E scripts/run-captions.py --url "<URL>" --style config/presets/red-card.json
```

Roughly **0.5–0.9x the video duration** end to end on a laptop RTX 3050 Ti.
A 16-minute video takes about 9 minutes.

## What it does

```
download → audio → transcribe ∥ overlays → ass → verify → render
```

- **Stages are resumable.** Each is skipped when its artifact exists; `--force
  <stage>` reruns it and everything after; `--stop-after <stage>` stops early.
- **Transcription and overlay detection run in parallel.** They're independent;
  overlay detection drops to CPU decode so the ASR model keeps the GPU.
- **Sync is proven, not assumed.** Before rendering, the caption layer is drawn
  onto black, sampled at word midpoints, and each probe asserts the word in the
  highlight colour is the one that should be active. The pipeline refuses to
  render if this fails.
- **The output is checked too** — duration match, bitrate sanity, faststart box
  order — and a manifest with tool versions and input hashes is written beside it.

## Styling

Every visual choice lives in a preset under `config/presets/`. Never edit code
to change how captions look.

| Key | Effect |
|---|---|
| `font.family` / `font.file` / `font.fontsdir` | typeface |
| `font.cap_height_px` | **preferred way to size text** — nominal size is derived |
| `font.bold` | 1 requests weight 700 |
| `text.uppercase`, `apostrophe`, `outline_px`, `shadow_px` | text treatment |
| `card.enabled`, `colour`, `alpha`, `corner_radius_px`, `pad_*_px` | the background card |
| `layout.anchor_x`, `bottom_margin_px`, `max_lines`, `max_line_width_px` | placement |
| `states.base` / `active` / `spoken` | `spoken == base` → spotlight; `spoken == active` → progressive karaoke fill |
| `pop.*` | scale animation on the active word |
| `grouping.*`, `timing.*` | words per card, breaks, lead-in/hold, fades |
| `overlays.colour` | colour of the *source's own* lower-third graphics, to dodge them |
| `render.*` | encoder, preset, cq, bitrate caps |

Presets are authored on a 1920x1080 canvas and every pixel value is scaled
automatically to the actual video, so 720p / 1440p / vertical all work.

Two presets ship: `red-card` (solid red info-card, yellow spotlight) and
`eu-navy` (EU-flag blue, star-yellow spotlight).

### Deriving a style from a reference

Measure, don't eyeball. Pull a few seconds of the reference, extract frames, and
take cap height / colours / radius / margins off a **native-resolution** frame.
For brand colours, mask a channel thumbnail to saturated pixels, quantise, and
read the dominant buckets.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12 with `faster-whisper`, `ctranslate2`, `fonttools`, `numpy`, `pillow`
- `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` built with **libass** (check: `ffmpeg -filters | grep ass`)
- `yt-dlp`
- Optional NVIDIA GPU. CUDA also needs `nvidia-cublas-cu12` — ctranslate2 bundles
  cuDNN but not cuBLAS. Without a working GPU the pipeline falls back
  automatically (`cuda/int8_float16 → cuda/int8 → cpu/int8`); CPU runs at roughly
  1x realtime instead of ~3x.

## Repo layout

| Path | |
|---|---|
| `scripts/run-captions.py` | the orchestrator — start here |
| `scripts/transcribe-words.py` | faster-whisper → word-level JSON |
| `scripts/detect-overlays.py` | finds the source's own lower-third graphics |
| `scripts/build-captions-ass.py` | words + preset → styled ASS |
| `scripts/verify-captions.py` | proves sync by probing rendered frames |
| `config/presets/` | all visual styling |
| `fonts/` | Montserrat Bold (SIL OFL 1.1, see `fonts/OFL.txt`) |
| `docs/karaoke-captions.md` | design notes and the traps behind them |
| `.claude/skills/video-captions/` | Claude Code skill |

`sources/`, `audio/`, `transcripts/`, `outputs/`, `temp/` are working
directories and are **git-ignored** — they hold third-party video and material
derived from it, which is never committed.

Of those, `transcripts/` is the only expensive artifact (minutes of GPU time);
everything in `temp/` regenerates in seconds.

## Gotchas worth knowing

These are load-bearing; `docs/karaoke-captions.md` has the full list with
evidence.

- **`python -X utf8 -E` is required** on the dev machine — a global `PYTHONPATH`
  pointing at another Python version breaks `faster_whisper`, and `sys.path` is
  frozen at startup so fixing it in-process doesn't work. `-E` also disables
  UTF-8 stdio on a cp1252 console, hence `-X utf8` too.
- **libass sizes fonts by `usWinAscent + usWinDescent`, not `unitsPerEm`.** For
  Montserrat that's 1562 vs 1000, so a nominal 43 px renders at 0.64x. This is
  why `font.cap_height_px` exists.
- **Variable fonts don't work** — libass registers only the default instance, so
  requesting weight 700 silently falls back to Arial. Use a static TTF.
- **YouTube AI auto-dubs** appear as extra audio tracks; a naive format selector
  can hand you a dubbed language and produce a fluent transcript of the wrong
  words. The selector pins the original track.
- **Never seek with plain `-ss` when burning subtitles** — it rebases PTS to 0 so
  libass renders the wrong lines. Use `--preview`, which regenerates a shifted ASS.
- **`-b:v 0` is required with `-cq`** or NVENC ignores the quality target.

## Legacy

`scripts/transcribe-audio.py` (OpenAI Whisper API) and
`scripts/generate-voiceover.py` (ElevenLabs TTS + ducking) predate this pipeline
and are unrelated to captions. Both have known bugs — `transcribe-audio.py` puts
the transcript text in its `file` field, and `generate-voiceover.py` computes
per-line start times then concatenates clips end to end, ignoring them.
`WORKSPACE-SETUP.md` documents that original scaffold and is partly stale.
